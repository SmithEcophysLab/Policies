## Smith Ecophysiology Lab Guidelines

Welcome to the [Smith Ecophysiology Lab at Texas Tech](https://www.smithecophyslab.com).
In this lab, we study interactions between terrestrial ecosystems, the global climate system, and other drivers of global change.
We tend to focus on plants, but as many of our colleagues remind us, we cannot forget about soils.
We use a combination of empirical studies at multiple scales and modeling to answer our questions.
Through our work, we hope to improve our understanding of how terrestrial ecosystems regulate climate and global change.
We use this work to improve the reliability of future projections of our ever-changing world.

### Mentoring Philosophy
Members of the Smith lab are scientists.
They are not individuals working on behalf of a scientist.
As such, all lab members have an equal and an equal say in the work that is performed by the lab.
As such, lab members are viewed as collaborators first and foremost.
This means that studnets, postdocs, and the PI will be responsible for their own destiny.
This also means that our relationships are reciprocal.
I hope to learn from you as you learn from me.

Having said that, I will strive to be available as often as possible to help in and out of lab, as needed.
I want to support, rather than guide, you in your scientific quest.
If I am in my office, I am available to talk with you.
I am also always available by email or phone.

I hope to make your experience in my lab as stress-free as possible.
If you are struggling, please let me know and I will do my best to help.
If you need certain accommodations, let me know and I will do everything in my power to make sure they are met.

As your current mentor, my primary goal is to help you reach your goals.
You define these goals and you define your success.
I will do my best to help you achieve them.

### Open Access Philosophy
I hope that all members of the Smith Lab will strive to make their work openly available.
Proprietary science leads to exclusion and we can only combat this by opening our doors.
While practicing open science will not be required or enforced, it will be highly recommended.
I will support lab members having issues making their science accessible.

### Code of Conduct
Please find the lab code of conduct [here](https://github.com/SmithEcophysLab/Policies/blob/master/Code_of_conduct.md).

### Lab Website
The lab website can be found [here](https://www.smithecophyslab.com).
The website was developed using GitHub Pages.
The Git repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/SmithEcophysLab/SmithEcophysLab.github.io).
Lab members will receive push access to the website to add or modify the master branch as needed.
The website is a representation of the lab as a whole.
As such, if you feel the website represents you or other lab members incorrectly, please let me know.
