## Smith Ecophysiology Lab Code of Conduct

The lab is not just a workspace. 
The lab is a group of scientists working together to achieve individual and collective goals.

The actions of our lab members are a reflection of the lab as a whole.
In this lab, we value inclusivity and do not tolerate discrimination of any kind, for any reason.
We value each individual and making the lab a welcoming place for all. Lab members are expected to respect each other as well as those in the TTU community and beyond.

We expect all lab members and visitors to adhere to the following:
* Don't be a jerk.
* Respect others, including those with beliefs different from yours.
* Behave professionally. This includes refraining from any form of harassment, discriminatory speech, and inappropriate jokes.
* If you are unsure whether a comment or action is inappropriate, refrain from saying or doing such action.
* If someone comments that your actions or speech are inappropriate, do not get defensive. Listen. Learn. Do better next time. 
* Include others. 
* Do not compete with fellow lab members. Instead, work together when possible.
* Refrain from singling out mistakes.

All forms of discrimination are inappropriate, but include discrimination based on
gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion.
All forms of harassment are inappropriate, but include 
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

All lab members will be expected to comply with this code of conduct at all times.
Any lab member found to be in breech of the code of conduct will be asked to comply immediately.

**Conflict resolution**
If you and someone else are having issues, the first step should be to try and discuss and resolve the issues with that person.
If that doesn't work or you do not feel comfortable approaching that person, you should reach out to a superior. Suggested
superiors include Nick, the graduate program coordinator, and/or appropriate administrative offices.
Under no circumstances should you gossip negatively behind someone's back. Try instead to resolve conflicts through the
avenues listed above.

Any and all complaints can be sent to [Nick Smith](mailto:nick.smith@ttu.edu).
All communication will be confidential.
